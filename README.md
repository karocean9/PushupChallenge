# PushupChallenge

The goal of this project is to find the number of pushups you are going to do with the following assumptions

Begin the challenge on January 1st with 1 pushup, then increase the amount by 1 every day. January 2 would be 2 pushups , january 3 would be 3 pushups, February 1st = 32 pushups, and on and on. Few parameters that are considered are

1) Pushups will only increase on work days.
2) The pushups will be divided into sets based on the month. For example, January is the forst month so pushups will be done in one set, february is the second month so pushups will be done in two sets.
3) Missed days will be made up by spinning a virtual spinner and applying the result of that spinner. The spinner includes options such as 2X, forgiven, co-worker does half etc.
